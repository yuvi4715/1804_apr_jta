    <h1>PIPES</h1>
    <p>In AngularJS there was a feature called filters.
        What filters did, was give you a way to modify model data before
        it got presented in the view. You would pull data from the controller
        and alter it before it got to the view.
    </p>
    <p>Angular 4 has this feature as well. And it works just like filter,
        except we call it 'piping' in angular 4.
    </p>
    <div *ngFor="let x of names">
        <p>{{x | uppercase}}</p>
    </div>
    <p>In the above example, we take a collection of names,
        and pass it through a pipe that converts the Strings to upper case.
