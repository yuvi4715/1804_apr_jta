    <h3>String Interpolation</h3>
    <p>Angular uses a concept called data binding.
        This boils down to how we can connect our front end (view)
        to our backend (components).
        Any data in our components needs to have a way to be transferred
        to the View (html file).

        One way to do this, is to use String interpolation.
    </p>
    <div>The value of componentVariable is: <b style="color:red">{{componentVariable}}</b></div>
    <p>The above example demonstrated pullting information from the component and displaying
        it on the view. String interpolation is essentially and expression langauge, in that,
        it can also perform expressions within.
    </p>
    <div>The value of 2 + 7 = {{2 + 7}} </div>
    <div>The author of this site is: {{someObject.author}}</div>
    <h3>Property Binding</h3>
    <p>Property binding is, yet, another way to bind business to the view.</p>
    <p>Buy applying square brackets to a tag attribute, we bind it as a property.</p>
    <p>NOTE: ngStyle is a directive provided by angular.</p>
    <div [ngStyle]=styleObject (click)=changeStyle()>I am stylized</div>
    <p>ngStyle is the property bound to a variable on the backend. In this case, 
        ngStyle looks for an object that can change the css of whatever element it is applied
        to.
    </p>
    <h3>EVENT BINDING</h3>
    <p>Event binding is used to pass information from the view to the component.</p>
    <p>Events are designated with parentheticals. -Jeff</p>
    <div (click)="doubleNum()">Click on me to double the number: {{num}}</div>
    <h3>Two Way Databinding</h3>
    <p>Up to this point, we have only seen, one way databinding. 
        IE, taking data from the view and passing it to the component.
        Or, taking data from the component and passing it to the view.
        With two-way binding, we provide a way to not only change data from the component
        with interaction on the view, but also represent the changed variable at the view level
        as well.
