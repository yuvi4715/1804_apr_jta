Below are the core ones (everyone MUST accomplish them)
--user login 
-account creation (admin and user role)
--admins must approve users before they can be used (isAdmin boolean, EZ)
-transactions, must support withdrawals and deposits (EZ methods)
-must use logging (use Log4j, pending)
-everything must NOT be in the main method. (call login() in the main, EZ)
-data must be persisted (saved in the DB, EZ)
-collect data inputs from console (scanner, EZ)

Flow:
1) Login
2) Display Menu
	a)Deposit
	b)Withdrawal
	If (admin)
		1. List newly created accounts waiting approval.
3) Log Out, display login screen

When account is created, generate number with sequence and display all info to the user, and that it will be waiting for approval.

In java app, create object with the properties of the user in the DB

Login should check isAdmin AND isApproved
